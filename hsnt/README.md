# Hyperspectral Neutron Data Preprocessing

There are four scripts in this folder.

## 1. `hsnt_prep_utils.py`

This script is a library of functions for hyperspectral neutron data preprocessing.

It contains the following functions:

### `load_data`
Loads open-beam or projection TIFF images from a given directory.

### `replace_zero`
Replaces zeros in the images with the median value of the 8 closest neighbors. If any zeros remain, they are replaced with `epsilon = 1e-8`.

### `smooth_open_beam`
Smooths the open-beam counts. This is useful because open beams do not contain sharp details, so smoothing reduces noise without losing important information.

### `compute_transmission`
Computes the ratio of projection counts to open-beam counts.

### `calibrate_background_ORNL_SNAP`
Corrects the gain difference between open beams and projections for attenuation data. These corrections are specific to ORNL SNAP beamline datasets.

### `hyper_data_preprocessing`
Performs all the above steps to convert raw neutron count data into attenuation or transmission data.

## 2. `demo_Ni_single_view.py`

This script preprocesses the Ni single-view datasets.

There are 10 datasets in total, corresponding to 5 different proton charges and 2 different Ni samples, and the script works for all of them.

The script calls the `hyper_data_preprocessing` function from `hsnt_prep_utils.py` to process the data and then saves the processed results as HDF5 files.

## 3. `demo_Ni_Cu_Al_FHR.py`

This script preprocesses the Ni-Cu-Al CT dataset and performs fast hyperspectral reconstruction (FHR).

It first uses `hyper_data_preprocessing` for preprocessing, then uses the MBIRTORCH `dehydrate`, `recon`, and `rehydrate` functions to perform FHR.

Because the dataset is large, the script avoids loading all angles into memory at once. Instead, it preprocesses and dehydrates the data one angle at a time.

## 4. `plot_utils.py`

This script contains a function called `plot_hyper_recons` to display hyperspectral reconstructions from different slices and wavelength indices.

## Note

All necessary libraries are already dependencies of MBIRTORCH. Therefore, simply activate your MBIRTORCH environment and run:

```bash
python demo_Ni_single_view.py
